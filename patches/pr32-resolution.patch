    chore: resolve merge conflict in vercel.json - use rewrites syntax from main
    
    The main branch has updated vercel.json to use the 'rewrites' syntax
    which is the current Vercel standard. This replaces the older 'routes'
    syntax with 'handle: filesystem'.
    
    Resolution: Accept main's version with rewrites configuration.
