## The Problem

The old repo has:
- 93 markdown files
- 23 open PRs
- 89 pages (most half-finished)
- 180+ components (many unused)
- A blocked CI/CD pipeline

**Result**: Stagnation. Nobody knows what to do.

---

## The Solution

Start clean. Build only what matters.

**MVP is:**
1. Radio (the heartbeat)
2. Nights/Beacons (what's happening)
3. Globe (where's the energy)
4. Care (visible exits)
5. Commerce (funding)

GHOSTED (social/discovery grid) exists but isn't the lead. This is not a dating app.

## The One Thing

> This is not a dating app with extra features. Radio is the heartbeat. Everything else orbits it.

If you build it like Grindr with a podcast player, you've failed.

If you build it like a room where the music's always on and people drift in and out, you've got it.

## Questions?

Read `01_PRODUCT.md` first. The answer is probably there.
