## KEY USPs NOT BEING HIGHLIGHTED ENOUGH

### 1. "No Swiping. No Ghosts."
**Problem**: This is a MASSIVE differentiator from Grindr/Tinder but only appears once on homepage.
**Recommendation**: 
- Add to hero section more prominently
- Create dedicated landing page explaining how compatibility-first works
- Use as tagline: "HOTMESS: No Swiping. No Ghosts."

### 2. "Real Time, Real Intent"
**Problem**: The RIGHT NOW feature (30min-Tonight with Can host/Travel/Hotel) is unique but not explained well.
**Recommendation**:
- Add "How RIGHT NOW Works" explainer
- Show status options prominently
- CTA: "POST YOUR AVAILABILITY"

### 3. "London OS"
**Problem**: Branding is unique but undefined. What is "London OS"?
**Recommendation**:
- Add "What is London OS?" section or page
- Explain it's an operating system for nightlife
- CTA: "EXPLORE LONDON OS"

### 4. Safety as Core Differentiator
**Problem**: Safety features are exceptional but buried in Care page.
**Recommendation**:
- Add safety badge/icon on homepage hero
- Create "Safety-First Dating" landing page
- CTA: "SEE OUR SAFETY FEATURES"

### 5. XP & Gamification
**Problem**: Full gamification system exists but not promoted on homepage.
**Recommendation**:
- Show current XP/level in header when logged in
- Add "Earn XP" callouts on features
- CTA: "START EARNING XP"

### 6. Creator Economy
**Problem**: Seller Mode, Creator Mode exist but no clear path to enable.
**Recommendation**:
- Add "Become a Creator" landing page
- CTA: "START SELLING"
- CTA: "UPLOAD YOUR MUSIC"
