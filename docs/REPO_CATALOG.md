### Remote copilot/* branches (ALL STALE — Feb 2026)
All `copilot/*` branches were automated GitHub Copilot agent branches from Feb 8–25, 2026. None contain code not already in `main`. Safe to delete after spot-check.

### Remote cursor/* branches
All `cursor/*` branches were Cursor IDE agent branches. Same situation — stale, pre-`main`.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Keep:** `~/hotmess-globe` — canonical live repo
2. **Archive locally:** `~/HOTMESS_BACKUP_20260131` — useful rollback reference
3. **Review then delete:** All Downloads copies — massive disk space, no unique code
4. **Preserve for extraction:** `~/Downloads/hotmess-london (10)` — has full multi-page brand HTML with pages not in current app (superhung, superhigh, djs, content, affiliates, lookbook, xxx)
5. **Keep for radio:** `~/Documents/GitHub/AzuraCast` — if self-hosted radio is planned
6. **Review:** `~/Documents/GitHub/hotmess-consolidated-build` — may contain consolidated work
7. **Delete remote stale branches:** All `copilot/*` and `cursor/*` branches on GitHub
