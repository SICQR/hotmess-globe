This document defines HOTMESS. Do not dilute, sanitise, or reframe it.

## CANONICAL CONTEXT (READ FIRST)

**HOTMESS is a men-only queer culture ecosystem built around music, nightlife, connection, and care.**

It exists because queer men already live complex, high-intensity lives — across sex, substances, creativity, pleasure, loneliness, and recovery — but are forced to navigate those realities separately, silently, or in shame.

HOTMESS brings those realities together openly, without moralising, without sanitising, and without pretending they don't exist.

**HOTMESS is not:**
- a dating app
- a grid
- a feed optimised for engagement

**HOTMESS is infrastructure** — a room people return to because:
- the music feels familiar
- the energy is legible
- connection doesn't collapse into chaos
- care doesn't disappear after the night ends

### Non-negotiables
- Men-only
- 18+
- Consent-first by design
- Harm reduction without moralising
- Care is visible, not buried
- No dark patterns
- No algorithmic shame loops

### Product spine
- **Radio** = daily ritual and belonging
- **Nights & Beacons** = presence without pressure
- **GHOSTED** = opt-in, temporary, contextual connection (the social/discovery grid)
- **Commerce** = funding, not extraction
- **Care** = visible exits and landings

**Every feature must answer:**
- what happens before
- what happens during
- what happens after

If a feature increases intensity, it must also increase clarity.  
If it creates connection, it must also allow withdrawal.

## PART 1 — THE VISION

### 1.1 In one sentence, what is HOTMESS?
> A queer culture OS where radio creates ritual, beacons create presence, and care is built into the architecture — not bolted on after harm happens.

### 1.2 Who is the ideal user?
> 25–40, gay/bi/queer man in London. Works in creative, hospitality, tech, or nightlife. Goes out 1–3 times a week. Uses Grindr but hates it. Follows DJs on Instagram. Has a group chat for nights out. Has experienced the crash after a big weekend and wished something existed that acknowledged that reality without judging it. Currently fragments his life across Grindr (sex), Resident Advisor (events), Spotify (music), WhatsApp (coordination), and nothing for aftercare.

### 1.3 What problem does HOTMESS solve that Grindr, Hinge, or Resident Advisor do not?
> Those apps treat queer life as separate transactions: fuck here, find events there, listen to music somewhere else, and deal with the emotional aftermath alone. HOTMESS treats it as one continuous experience. The same app that plays you into your day with radio also shows you who's out tonight, lets you land somewhere warm if the night gets heavy, and doesn't pretend the comedown doesn't exist. It's infrastructure for the whole cycle, not just the peaks.

### 1.4 If HOTMESS had to be known for ONE thing, what would it be?
- [ ] Dating / hookups
- [ ] Events / listings
- [x] Radio-led queer culture with built-in care
- [ ] Marketplace
- [ ] Safety-first app
- [ ] Other: __________________

## PART 2 — WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS (MVP)

### 2.1 Rank these features for launch (1 = most important)

| Feature | Rank | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Radio (live shows, DJs, culture) | 1 | The daily ritual. This is what makes HOTMESS different. |
| Events / Nights | 2 | What's happening tonight. Discovery without pressure. |
| Beacons & Globe | 3 | Presence visualization. Where energy is. |
| GHOSTED (social/discovery grid) | 4 | Connection, but opt-in and contextual. Not the core. |
| Marketplace (merch, drops) | 5 | Funding mechanism. HNH MESS merch, vinyl, culture objects. |
| Creator economy | 6 | Post-MVP. Let the culture establish first. |
| Gamification | 7 | Nice to have. XP and streaks can wait. |

### 2.2 What features can launch after MVP?
> Creator economy (subscriptions, PPV, tips), gamification (XP, leaderboards, challenges), ticket resale marketplace, video calls, advanced AI features (Wingman, Scene Scout, Profile Optimizer), business/promoter dashboard, squad/group features.

### 2.3 The ONE user journey that must work perfectly at launch
> User opens app → Radio is playing (feels like walking into the room) → sees tonight's Beacons on the globe → taps one → sees who's going / vibe / details → RSVPs → night happens → next morning, Care surfaces gently ("You good?") → user returns to Radio → cycle continues.

## PART 3 — LOOK & FEEL

### 3.1 Reference products you respect

| App / Site | What works |
|------------|------------|
| Resident Advisor | Editorial respect for music culture. Events feel curated, not listed. |
| Arc Browser | Dark, minimal, powerful. Doesn't try to be friendly — just works. |
| Poolside FM | Vibes as interface. Music sets the tone. You feel it before you use it. |

### 3.2 What's right about the current design or concept?
> The brutalist luxury direction. Hot pink on black. The globe as a presence visualizer. The brand voice ("Don't make the same mistake twice unless he's hot"). The unapologetic queerness. The care language that's visible but not preachy.

### 3.3 What feels wrong or frustrating?
> Too many features competing for attention. The globe is impressive but the UI around it is cluttered. Social/profiles feel like they're trying to be Grindr when they should feel like something else. The navigation is busy. Radio should be more prominent — it's buried when it should be the heartbeat. Some pages feel half-built and the inconsistency breaks trust.

### 3.4 Describe the vibe (3–5 adjectives)
> Dark, warm, underground, knowing, held.

### 3.5 What should users feel when they open HOTMESS?
> Like walking into a room where the music's already playing and people know your name. Not anxious. Not performing. Just... here.

---

## PART 7 — LAUNCH

### 7.1 Launch city / region
> London. The culture is here. The nights are here. The radio makes sense here first.

### 7.2 First 100 users
> Personal network. DJs and promoters who are already in the culture. People who've been to the nights. Hand-select people who get it and will seed the energy correctly.

### 7.3 First 1,000 users
> Radio as the hook. Daily shows create habit. Share clips on Instagram/TikTok. Partner with 2–3 key nights to be the official "what's happening" for those events. Word of mouth from the 100 who actually use it.

### 7.4 Why do people come back?
> Radio. The music is playing. The vibe is there whether or not they're going out tonight. It becomes the background to their day, and when they do want to go out, HOTMESS is already open.

---

## PART 8 — CORE SYSTEMS

### 8.1 Pillars at launch
- [ ] All four
- [x] Radio, Nights, Commerce
- [ ] One pillar only

*Note: Social/Connection exists but is secondary. Not a grid-first app.*

### 8.2 Globe
- [x] Core
- [ ] Nice to have
- [ ] Remove

*The globe is presence visualization. It shows where energy is without making it transactional. Keep it, but simplify what's around it.*

### 8.3 Telegram integration
- [ ] Critical
- [x] Nice to have
- [ ] Not needed

*Some users prefer it for auth. Not critical for MVP but good to have.*

### 8.4 Existing PRs
- [x] Merge what's ready, close the rest
- [ ] Review all
- [ ] Ignore

*23 open PRs is paralysis. Merge #33 (lint fix), #41 (CI fix), close the rest. Start clean.*

### 8.5 Beacons & Presence
> Beacons are time-limited signals on the map/globe. They say "something is happening here, now." They're opt-in — you choose to light one. They're visual — a pulse, a glow, not a notification. They're comforting even without response — seeing beacons means the world is alive, even if you don't join. Presence over performance. No likes, no counts, no anxiety. Just: "I'm here" or "something's happening there."

---

## PART 9 — SUCCESS

### 9.1 Success after 3 months
> 1,000 active users in London. Radio has 200+ daily listeners. 50+ beacons lit per week. 3 key nights using HOTMESS as their platform. Revenue from subscriptions (even small). Users return 3+ times per week. Care features used without stigma.

### 9.2 Success after 12 months
> 10,000 active users. Expanded to 2–3 more cities (Berlin, NYC, Sydney). Radio is recognized as a cultural institution in queer London. Promoters pay for tools. Marketplace generating real revenue. HOTMESS is the answer to "what's happening tonight?" — not Grindr, not RA, not a WhatsApp group.

### 9.3 Failure looks like
> Another grid. Another app that promises care but buries it. Users open it, feel the same anxiety they feel on Grindr, and leave. Radio is ignored. Beacons feel like a gimmick. The nights don't adopt it. It becomes a side project that never shipped.

---

## PART 10 — FINAL TRUTH

### 10.1 What wasn't asked but matters?
> The radio shows are real. RAW CONVICT exists. The DJs are real. The nights are real. This isn't a hypothetical product — it's a culture that already exists offline and needs a home online. The build isn't starting from zero culturally, even if the tech needs work.

### 10.2 ONE thing builders must understand
> This is not a dating app with extra features. Radio is the heartbeat. Everything else orbits it. If you build this like Grindr with a podcast player, you've failed. If you build it like a room where the music's always on and people drift in and out, you've got it.

### 10.3 Absolute dealbreakers
> No dark patterns. No algorithmic shame (endless scroll, engagement hooks, notification spam). No sanitizing the reality of queer life. No burying Care behind menus. No making Radio optional or secondary.

---

## SUMMARY

**HOTMESS is:**  
> A queer culture OS built around radio, nightlife, and care — infrastructure for the whole cycle, not just the highs.

**For:**  
> Gay/bi/queer men in London (25–40) who go out, who feel the crash after, who want something that acknowledges their whole reality without judgment.

**MVP includes:**  
> Radio (live shows, daily ritual), Nights/Beacons (what's happening, where's the energy), Globe (presence visualization), Commerce (merch, funding), Care (visible exits, aftercare). GHOSTED (social/discovery) exists but isn't the lead.

**Launch target:**  
> Q1 2026. London first.

**Vibe:**  
> Dark, warm, underground, knowing, held.

**Success =**  
> Users return for the radio. The music's always playing. The nights know about it. Care is used without stigma. It feels like a room, not an app.
